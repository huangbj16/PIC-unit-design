# Serial communication and waveform generation using PIC16F chips

This repo is a MPLAB X IDE project that uses PIC16F chips (15214/18313) to implement serial communication (EUSART) and waveform generation (square wave generated by TIMER INTERRUPT).

The main files are the main.c and config.c files for the two chips.
